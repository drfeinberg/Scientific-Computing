    "CodingLab labs are meant to be interactive.  Coding is something that you can do on your own or with other people. So, depending on your style, you can find another person to work with in labs, or you can go your own way.  If you want to work with someone, but can't find a partner, let me know.  I can find you a partner. Regardless, you should always be submitting your own work.  Having a partner doesn't mean copying someone else's work, it means helping each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CodingLabs are also meant to be exploratory. There are broad questions in the notebook that you should explore, and try to answer - but you are also very much encouraged to explore other related ideas as you go! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a question about how something works / what something does - try it out, and see what happens!"
